# Headings Are Important
- Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.
- Users often skim a page by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure.
- **h1** headings should be used for main headings, followed by **h2** headings, then the less important **h3**, and so on.
- Note: Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make text BIG or bold.
# HTML Display
- You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed.
- Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.
- With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.
- The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed (In HTML, spaces and new lines are ignored).
